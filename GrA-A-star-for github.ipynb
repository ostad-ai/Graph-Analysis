    "### A* algorithm\n",
    "**A\\* algorithm** is an **informed** search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start node to a goal node by combining:\n",
    "- Actual cost from start ($g(n)$) - like Dijkstra\n",
    "- Heuristic estimate to goal ($h(n)$) - greedy guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "We may express A* algorithm for a given **graph**, **start** node, and **goal** node as:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize**:  \n",
    "   - `g(start) = 0`, `f(start) = h(start)`  \n",
    "   - Add `start` to open set (min-heap by `f`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **While open set not empty**:  \n",
    "   a. Pop node `current` with lowest `f`  \n",
    "   b. If `current == goal`, reconstruct and return path  \n",
    "   c. For each neighbor:  \n",
    "      - `tentative_g = g(current) + cost`  \n",
    "      - If better path found:  \n",
    "        • Update `g`, `f`, and `came_from`  \n",
    "        • Push neighbor to open set\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **If goal not reached**, return **no path**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Here, we know that:  \n",
    "> - `g(n)` = cost from start to `n`  \n",
    "> - `h(n)` = heuristic to goal  \n",
    "> - `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key points about A* algorithm for a graph $G=(V,E)$:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O((|V|+|E|) log |V|) but with a good heuristic it is much less\n",
    "- **Space complexity:** O(|V|+|E|)\n",
    "- **Optimality:** Guarantees shortest paths with non-negative weights with an admissible heuristic\n",
    "- **Completeness:** Always finds a solution if one exists in finite graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder:** **Completeness** in search algorithms refers to whether the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists.\n",

    "<hr>\n",

    "In the following, we implement A* algorithm with a min-heap as a priority queue (similar to the Dijkstra's algorithm). Then, we use if for a simple graph and find the shortest path from a start node to a goal node. \n",

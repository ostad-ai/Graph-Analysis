Programs related to the field of **Graph Analysis** are expessed here. More on Graph Analysis is at the following link:

## History:
**Graph theory** is said to be originated by the work of **Leonard Euler** when dealing by the **Konigsberg** bridge problem. He abstracted the lands (four) by nodes and the bridges (seven) by edges. 
 - However, Islamic Scholars (9thâ€“14th centuries) used tree diagrams for lineage and knowledge organization.

The **Konigsberge bridge problem** asks to start at any land areas of the city, walk over each of the seven bridges exactly once, and return to the starting point. Euler proved that there is no solution for this problem.  
## Topics:
1) **What is a graph?** A graph is a mathematical structure to represent *relationships* between *objects*. Objects are **nodes** (vertices), and relationships are **edges** (links). 
Here, we review the graph definition, and discuss **undirected** graphs versus **directed** graphs with examples in Python.

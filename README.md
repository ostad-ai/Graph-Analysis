# Graph-Analysis 
Programs related to the field of **Graph Analysis** are expessed here. More on Graph Analysis is at the following link:

## History:
**Graph theory** is said to be originated by the work of **Leonard Euler** when dealing by the **Konigsberg bridges problem**. He abstracted the lands (four) by nodes and the bridges (seven) by edges. 
 - However, Islamic Scholars (9thâ€“14th centuries) used tree diagrams for lineage and knowledge organization.

The **Konigsberg bridges problem** asks to start at any land areas of the city, walk over each of the seven bridges exactly once, and return to the starting point. Euler proved that there is no solution for this problem.  
## Topics:
1) **What is a graph?** A graph is a mathematical structure to represent *relationships* between *objects*. Objects are **nodes** (vertices), and relationships are **edges** (links). 
Here, we review the graph definition, and discuss **undirected** graphs versus **directed** graphs with examples in Python.
2) **Graph: Adjacency matrix** For a graph with *n* nodes, the **adjacency matrix** is of size *n*-by-*n*. For **simple graphs**, the entries of the adjacency matrix is composed of zeros and ones. For undirected graphs, this matrix is *symmetric*.
Here, we give the Python code for defining the adjacency matrix for different types of graphs.
3) **Graph: Node degree** The **degree** of a node in graph is a simple concept which is quite useful in analyzing and understanding the graph. The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to the node. The definition of node degree for directed graphs includes in-degrees and out-degrees. 
We have some interesting formulae regarding the node degrees. For example, the **degree sum formula** (handshaking lemma) states that the sum of degrees of nodes in a graph is twice the number of the edges of the graph. 
Here, we review the concept of degrees in graphs by examples in Python.
4) **Adjacency list:** The adjacency list is another way to represent graphs. It is a data structure holding a list of nodes of a graph such that each node in the list stores its neighbors. Adjacency lists are particularly efficient for **sparse graphs** such as social networks, web graphs, and biological networks.
Here, we implement a Python class for a graph which holds the adjacency list of the graph in a *defaultdict*. We build two graphs by our class and show their adjacency lists. As a bonus, a Python function has also been defined to convert our graph to that of *NetworkX*.

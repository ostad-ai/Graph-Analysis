# Graph-Analysis 
Programs related to the field of **Graph Analysis** are expessed here. More on Graph Analysis is at the following link:

## History:
**Graph theory** is said to be originated by the work of **Leonard Euler** when dealing by the **Konigsberg bridges problem**. He abstracted the lands (four) by nodes and the bridges (seven) by edges. 
 - However, Islamic Scholars (9thâ€“14th centuries) used tree diagrams for lineage and knowledge organization.

The **Konigsberg bridges problem** asks to start at any land areas of the city, walk over each of the seven bridges exactly once, and return to the starting point. Euler proved that there is no solution for this problem.  
## Topics:
1) **What is a graph?** A graph is a mathematical structure to represent *relationships* between *objects*. Objects are **nodes** (vertices), and relationships are **edges** (links). 
Here, we review the graph definition, and discuss **undirected** graphs versus **directed** graphs with examples in Python.
2) **Graph: Adjacency matrix** For a graph with *n* nodes, the **adjacency matrix** is of size *n*-by-*n*. For **simple graphs**, the entries of the adjacency matrix is composed of zeroes and ones. For undirected graphs this matrix is *symmetric*.
Here, we give the Python code for defining the adjacency matrix for different types of graphs.

    "### Greedy best-first search\n",
    "**Greedy best-first search** is an **informed** search algorithm that expands the node that appears to be closest to the goal based solely on the heuristic function. Thus, the evaluation function $f(n)$ is:\n",
    "- $f(n)=h(n)$, where $h(n)$ is a heuristic estimate to goal - solely greedy guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key points about GBFS for a graph $G=(V,E)$:\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** O((|V|+|E|) log |V|) but with a good heuristic it is faster\n",
    "- **Space complexity:** O(|V|)\n",
    "- **Optimality:** It is not Guaranteed\n",
    "- **Completeness:** Always finds a solution if one exists in finite graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reminder:** **Completeness** in search algorithms refers to whether the algorithm is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Despite not being optimal, GBFS is used when:\n",
    "- Speed matters more than optimality (e.g., real-time games)\n",
    "  - Common in game AI for quick path approximations\n",
    "- Memory is limited (simpler than A*)\n",
    "- Heuristic is very accurate (e.g., GPS with clear line-of-sight)\n",
    "- As a component in hybrid algorithms (e.g., beam search)  \n",

    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we implement greedy best-first search (GBFS) with a min-heap as a priority queue (similar to the Dijkstra's algorithm and A* algorithm). Then, we use if for a simple grid graph to find the possibly shortest path from a start node to a goal node. \n",
